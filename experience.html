            <strong>Tutor, Leadership Peer Support Program (September 2018 - January 2019)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the Leadership Peer Support Program at Chaminade College school, I had the opportunity to mentor and tutor grade 
                    nine students who were struggling academically. I held the responsibility of tutoring two students twice a week who 
                    were specifically struggling in math. As a tutor, I was able to communicate various concepts clearly and improve my 
                    students overall academic performance.

                <li>
                    As a tutor, I was presented with multiple challenges that I had to overcome. By patiently connecting and understanding 
                    my students, I became an excellent role model that they can look up to.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    In 2019, I had the opportunity to be involved in the grade nine orientation program as a core team member. Being a 
                    part of the core team, it was our responsibility to work alongside teachers to plan an overnight camping excursion 
                    for the grade nine students. I was tasked to create an informational booklet to present to students about the camp 
                    experience and prepare senior students to be leaders and look after the grade nine students while at camp.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a member of the core team, I had the opportunity to learn how to effectively work in a group setting while trying 
                    to organize an event in a few months. Through this experience, I developed my skills working in a team environment 
                    while also becoming a reliable person who can complete tasks efficiently and effectively.

            <strong>Seafood Clerk, Metro Inc (August 2021-August 2022)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For a year, I worked at Metro Inc. as a seafood clerk. The responsibilities in which i held included stocking and 
                    serving customers with the hope of fulfilling their needs. I was also responsible for working with other employees 
                    to either set up the seafood counter in the morning or takedown and clean the counter at night. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Through this working environment, I was able to develop my collaboration skills and grow a better understanding of 
                    what it is like to work with customers. While working efficiently with other employees, the seafood department will 
                    be able to place products on the sales floor promptly. Additionally, this experience has helped me to understand how 
                    to effectively communicate with various customers to satisfy their needs.
