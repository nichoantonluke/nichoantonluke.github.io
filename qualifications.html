                As the Secretary-General of the Chaminade Model United Nations (CHAMUN) in 2019, I became dependable and 
                well-organized as I planned out with the help of my team, our own Model United Nations. The team hosted 
                multiple high schools across Toronto for the two-day event.

                I work extremely well in a group environment as I helped plan out a Pasta Bingo Night along with other members 
                of the Leadership Program at Chaminade College School in November of 2018. Our event was a huge success as the 
                team was able to raise over a thousand dollars for Jakeâ€™s House Charity supporting families living with autism.

                I possess strong presentation and communication skills as I have worked with the WAVE (Working Against Violence 
                Everyday) Youth Action Team to bring awareness to over 200 elementary students about the legalization of cannabis 
                and the negative impact it has on youth.

                Through volunteering experiences such as Jake's House Christmas Party and World Autism Day, while also working 
                part-time at Metro Inc, I have developed strong social and customer satisfaction skills.
